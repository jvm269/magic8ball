# Convultional Neural Network Project - Hand-writing recognition




Proposal:  
Creating a user interactive interface that utilizes machine leanring to identify handwritten numbers and capital letters.

Data Set:  
https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r2.0/api_docs/python/tf/keras/datasets/mnist/load_data
Data is extracted from the Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology  (Mnist) Database. The dataset contains handwritten digits that are used to train image processing systems, especially for Machine Learning. 

Dataset contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images. 

Significance: Data can be used for Graphology, which is the study of handwritten patterns indiciating a persons' current psychological state. It is commonly used to determine personality characteristics/Pseudoscience. The purpose of this project can be used to help provide criminologists with technological tools for further insight into criminal assessment.
